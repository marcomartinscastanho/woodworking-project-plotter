# woodworking-project-plotter

Very hardocded application of the [Rectangle packing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle_packing) problem with [Guillotine cutting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillotine_cutting) for a specific woodworking project.  
Uses [rectpack](https://github.com/secnot/rectpack) to determine the cuts and [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) to plot the outcome.


I may one day make this re-usable if I need it again.
